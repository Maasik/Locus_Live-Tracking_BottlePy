### ToDo

The next steps to work on could be the following:

* Reuse the code for the map in the different jinja2 templates.
* Display the current location:
  * A box on the home page: "Philipp is currently here: "
* Make tracks downloadable as GPX  
  This could be implemented in an API call /api/gpx?name=<name>&period=<weeks>
* Extend the information stored in events:
  The API call to POST an /event could store more parameters:
  * user name
  * current mission / track
